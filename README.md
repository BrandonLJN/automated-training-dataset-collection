# automated-training-dataset-collection
This project shows the code for an automated training dataset collection system of a 915km 12 span optical communication system.  To realize large-scale generation and collection of  training dataset from experimental environment for ML-based QoT estimation, we build an optical fiber transmission system which can automatically set and monitor various optical parameters including the launch power (LP) of each laser, total input power of each fiber, VOAs' attenuations and EDFAs' gains for the Tx, Rx and middle nodes
